# SocialBudgetApp
ðŸ’¡ Management of individual financial profiles could benefit from the distributed containerization of kuperneties. 


<h1>Kubernetes Deployment</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This idea was sparked by a conversation with my fincial advisor regarding transparency and community support for financial well-being. The finance world does not have a widely accepted social media platform and individuals could use creative ways to improve the financial standing. The targeted audience is younger generations that use social media already, admire gamification and enjoy streak and yearly-breakdown culture.
